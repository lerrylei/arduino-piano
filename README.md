# mechKeyPiano
A mechanical keyboard... but the OTHER type of "keyboard"

A DIY 3D printed keyboard using 12 mechanical keyboard switches for piano keys! Powered with an Arduino UNO and fitted with a speaker and a potentiometer to change between 3 octaves.

## Design
3D overview of the keyboard case. I printed using a .4mm nozzle and 20% infill. Supports are necessary for some parts but do not put too many.

Since the STL files were larger than my print area, I had to split the case into [multiple parts (https://github.com/lerrylei/mechKeyPiano/tree/main/CAD%20Files/Split%20CAD).
