# mechKeyPiano
A mechanical keyboard... but the OTHER type of "keyboard"

A DIY 3D printed keyboard using 12 mechanical keyboard switches for piano keys! Powered with an Arduino UNO and fitted with a speaker and a potentiometer to change between 3 octaves.

## Design
3D overview of the keyboard case. I printed using a .4mm nozzle and 20% infill. Since the STL file was a bit too large for my printer, I had to split the case into [multiple parts](https://github.com/lerrylei/mechKeyPiano/tree/main/CAD%20Files/Split%20CAD).
